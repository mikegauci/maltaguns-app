                        In Malta, you need a Category B license for most
                        firearms, which requires completing a firearms safety
                        course, passing a background check, and demonstrating a
                        legitimate reason for ownership, such as sport shooting
                        or collecting. Different license types exist for
                        different weapon categories, and requirements vary
                        accordingly.

                        obtain the appropriate license from the Police

                        purchase from a registered dealer or private seller. The
                        transaction must be registered with the authorities, and
                        the weapon must be transported safely and stored
                        securely according to regulations.

                        What are the storage requirements for firearms?

                      <AccordionContent>
                        Maltese law requires firearms to be stored in an
                        approved gun safe that complies with specific security
                        standards. Ammunition must be stored separately from
                        firearms. Your storage arrangements may be inspected by
                        the police as part of the licensing process or during
                        random checks.

                        When transporting firearms in Malta, they must be
                        unloaded and secured in a locked case or container.
                        Ammunition should be transported separately. You must
                        carry your firearms license with you, and transport
                        should be direct between authorized locations (e.g.,
                        residence, shooting range, gunsmith).
